Chitter Challenge
=================

Creating a twitter-clone (using Ruby, HTML, CSS, PSQL and TDD process) that will allow the user to post messages to a public stream, based on the following description: https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge


## Goal
User can sign in and share posts. User can see posts in reverse chronological order. Posts show at what time they were created.

## My progress so far:

- User can put nickname
- User can type message
- Database stores the automatic ID, nickname and message
- User can see peeps in reverse chronological order (newest message on top)
- User can see the time, when post was created, in a long format
- added some basic CSS to make the website look prettier (Comment button doesn't do anything yet, it's just the look)
- 100% test coverage so far

## The following things are need to be done:
- Allow user to sign up/sign in
- Showing shoerter time format
- Improve CSS and look of website
- Unit test now failing :( I'll have to fix it to pass the timestamp part


Type the name you want to display and the message you want to share with the world, and see the peeps from newest to oldest:
