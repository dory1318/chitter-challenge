Chitter Challenge
=================

Creating a twitter-clone (using Ruby, HTML, CSS, PSQL and TDD process) that will allow the user to post messages to a public stream, based on the following description: https://github.com/makersacademy/chitter-challenge


## Goal
User can sign in and share posts. User can see posts in reverse chronological order. Posts show at what time they were created.

## My progress so far:

- User can put nickname
- User can type message
- Database stores the automatic ID, now timestamp, nickname and message
- User can see peeps in reverse chronological order (newest message on top)
- User can see the time, when post was created, in a long format
- added some basic CSS to make the website look prettier (Comment button doesn't do anything yet, it's just the look)
- 100% test coverage so far

## The following things are need to be done:
- Allow user to sign up/sign in
- Showing shoerter time format
- Improve CSS and look of website
- I want to separate a log in page, then chats being shown on a separate page using nickname provided on previous page

## Peek:
Type the name you want to display and the message you want to share with the world:
